## üî≠ Projects
- [Delta Communication](https://deltacommunication.xyz): Created and deployed a full stack web app for a local network provider, used django to create API views for the react frontend. Mostly being used to take form submissions from users, that include complaint noting and new admissions. Used AWS services to deploy the app on the domain, click the name to visit the website.
- [Chord engine](https://www.chordengine.com): (Still in development) The idea for Chordengine is that it should be a music based social media platform. We are still working on the nooks and crannies of the site, but the basic platform is up and running. The most difficult part was getting the mongoDB database to work with the django backend. Since django has no official support for mongoDB the only way was to create my own engine and settings to make it run with the database. Which was a hassle but succesfully implemented. You can visit the website and check out the initial features of the website. Some features include saving guitar details for the users and uploading, deleting and playing audio in the website.
- [Westgate Capital](https://westgatecapital.netlify.app/): (Lacking a domain and backend but deployed on amplify for frontend viewing) This website is created for a real estate company in Montreal. The main features of the website include, a simple but captivating UI and a showcase of the properties provided by the company. You can check the frontend out by clicking the link, the website was created using reactJS and django.
- [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/burhanmoin1/Portfolio-website-frontend): Currently developing a beautifully animated portfolio website to showcase my frontend skills, the website will also double as a blog website for me so I have a platform to share my findings with the world.
- [Full Stack Web App Generator](https://github.com/burhanmoin1/Full-Stack-App-Generator): Working on a full stack web app generator using C++. The main feature with the app will be able to input pre-written code into visual studio code with just a push of a button. Just started on this so let's see where it goes.
